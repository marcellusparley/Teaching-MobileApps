# App 2 - Camera + Image Effects
This is a simple application that can either take images from the camera or your device's gallery and then in a second view apply various effects to that image. It's purpose is mostly to meat the homework requirement and to learn. It's a fun little app to play around in.

## Requirements
This was tested mostly on a galaxy tab and android 7+. It probably requires a bit of power as the effects are rather slow. It requires use of your device's camera and access to write to it's storage.

## Usage
The usage is fairly simple.

Upon opening the application, you are given the two options of Camera or Image Gallery. Hitting either button will bring up your device's camera or gallery app. After taking or selecting an image, the app switches to the edit activity which displays that image with controls to apply effects beneath.

To apply the effects you simply select one from the dropdown box and hit apply. Afterwards you can keep applying new effects or choose either the Return or Save buttons. The Return button kills the edit activity and brings you back to the initial screen while the Save button saves a copy of the current image to the "CameraExamples" directory in your device's storage.
