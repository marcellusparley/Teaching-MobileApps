# PROJECT 4 POST MORTEM

The refactor of project 3 wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be. This is probably because of the good sources of information I was able to find after a bit of digging that went over a lot of what I was trying to accomplish in adding the drawing code. I still wouldn't call it easy though, I spent a lot of time banging my head against the wall trying to adapt some android studio examples on stack overflow to c# for drawing and then later for saving the view to a bitmap. The former problem was solved with a xamarin example/tutorial on multi-touch (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/android/app-fundamentals/touch/touch-tracking) and the later was solved by copying the DrawingCache to a bitmap and just using that variable instead of saving it to a file. Also I sank a lot of time into figuring out how to use a custom view class in a layout thanks to a bunch of misinformation out there that google seems to love giving me. It was a while before I figured out that I needed to register the class. In the end I think everything turned out better than I had expected. Though that is probably largely due to the tutorial covering exactly what I needed and working out of the box. If it weren't for that I might have not made the due date.

My biggest challenge was probably my own procrastination. Before and during the beginning part of the break I had a hard time trying to decide what I wanted to do for pa4. At some point, I thought I wanted to do a short game based on a cut down version of my project pitch and I even got as far as making small test version in Godot. I could move and tilt the device and look at the gyroscope and accelerometer data. However I didn't really work on anything over the Break and figured making a game would take too long so I decided on dumping that idea and go on to refactor my pa3. I didn't get started on it until Sunday which was a big time mistake. The next couple of days were a real pain but I got it done on time. Truthfully I regret not being able to think of something else more creative and different for my project 4. Even the game idea I worked on for a bit I wasn't too happy about doing (that's probably why I was okay dropping it so easily). Oh well I guess I can't complain too much in the end.
